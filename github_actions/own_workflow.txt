Creating an example workflow

GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax to define the workflow. Each workflow is stored as a separate YAML file in your code repository, in a directory named .github/workflows.

You can create an example workflow in your repository that automatically triggers a series of commands whenever code is pushed

In this workflow, GitHub Actions checks out the  pushed code install the bats testing framework and runs a basic command to output the bats version;

bats -v.
